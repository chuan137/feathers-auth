# Feathersjs Example with Authentication

> 

## About

I build this project while getting familiar with feathersjs, which is a light weight server stack for nodejs. One can build and extend api easily with services and hooks. Since feathersjs is under heavy development, it is a bit difficult for me to follow the details in the docs to build a real project. I am sharing this to help others who might want to jump in quickly.

## Features
1. feathers-authentication 1.0 instead of 0.7
2. Email notification with feathers-authentication-management
3. Tests with promises
